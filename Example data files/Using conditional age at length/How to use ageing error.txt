Ageing Error

You can also explore ageing error, with either the default ageing error being no bias and high precision (Ageing error_no_error.csv example file), or adding custom ageing error for mean age and standard deviation at age (Ageing error_two_error_matrices.csv example file).
You must provide entries from age 0 to max age.

User's can assign any ageing error matrix to each age entry. See the "Ageing_error" column for where to assign the available ageing error matrix. See also the SS user manual for more information.
